## Definition

The program is a simulator, in which the user is allotted an initial sum of funding ($100,000), and is presented with various choices of where he does the banking, which manager to use, and also have the choice of what security to invest in (can choose 5 options, of any of either stocks or cryptocurrencies).

## Importance

There is an inherent importance in understanding the way that our economy works and money management in general. First person shooters are a fun way to pass the time, but nothing is learned. This simulator will provide a fun experience juxtaposed with a learning experience as well. The comical dialogue during the day will make for a lighthearted time, but when the immediate response is provided at the end of the day, the user may be hit with a reality check if they did not make the right decisions with their money. This practice with testing strategies in buying and selling stocks and managing money in an efficient manner will ideally prepare the user for the real world applications.

## Inputs

The user will be making many decisions in the simulator. They will make an initial decision for which bank they wish to use. Then they will make a decision of which 5 investments to make. These investments will then have daily decisions that must be made, the user will need to input whether they want to buy, sell, or hold the investments.

## Outputs

There will be outputs associated with each of the user’s inputs. When the user picks a bank there will be data output such as associated fees. When the user makes initial investments there will be outputs of the current value of the investment as well as the history. Each day they user will have “daily news” outputs that hint at the way each investment is trending. The user will then make their daily decisions, and will receive an immediate response. At the end of the day the user will be provided with a market data graph for that day. The final type of output will be the long term response that the user will receive at the end of the 7 day period.
