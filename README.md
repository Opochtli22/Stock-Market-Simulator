	THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO BE RUN IN LINUX.

This project is designed to provide a basic data plotting and data visualization
tool for use especially with stock market data. We use SFML libraries for plotting
the data.

?? Other modules we might add to the documentation:
	data fetching API's
	analysis tools (moving averages, regression, etc)
	relational database querying
	handling of money for a "premium service"
	Whatever else we can come up with
